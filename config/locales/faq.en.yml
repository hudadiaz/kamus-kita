      word:
        question: What word can I submit?
        answer: You can submit any word that you have ever used or come across in life. It doesn't matter even if you created it. You can submit new definitions for existing words too if you think the present definitions lacking.
      defintion:
        question: What should I put in word definition?
        answer: Describe about how, why and when it's used. Write what you know about the word, especially how you would use it.
      example:
        question: What example should I give?
        answer: Give as many examples you can on how the word is used especially if you're inventing a new word because only you know it.
    votes:
      like:
        question: Why should I like a definition? What happens if I do?
        answer: If you like what you read, like it. The most liked definitions will be used by default to define the word.
      dislike:
        question: Why should I dislike a definition? What happens if I do?
        answer: If you think the definition is not useful/helpful, dislike it. Disliking a word gives penalty to the submitter, and make it less likely to be used by default to define the word.
      ignore:
        question: Why should I ignore a definition? What happens if I do?
        answer: When you don't care. Nothing happens. You can change your vote at any time.
